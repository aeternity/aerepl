#+TITILE: AEREPL
#+SUBTITLE: The Read-Eval-Print Loop for Sophia

Try Sophia, test your contracts, check "what if", calculate a factorial. Completely offline,
not depending on any remote (readonly sync may be included later).

** Setup

Currently, to launch the REPL you need to:

Clone the repo:
#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/radrow/aerepl.git
#+END_SRC

Clone the node:
#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity.git
#+END_SRC


Copy apps:
#+BEGIN_SRC
cp -r aeternity/apps aerepl
#+END_SRC


Launch the rebar3 shell
#+BEGIN_SRC
cd aerepl
./rebar3 shell
#+END_SRC


After it loads, launch the repl
#+BEGIN_SRC
aerepl:start()
#+END_SRC

Future relases will simplify it.

** Usage

You can type any arbitrary Sophia expression to evaluate it, for instance
#+BEGIN_SRC
AESO> 2 + 2
4
#+END_SRC

Beside that, the REPL supports other functionally via /commands/ that are prepended by ~:~. The default command is ~:eval~, which is executed when no other command was chosen, for instance
#+BEGIN_SRC
AESO> :eval 2 + 2
4
#+END_SRC

*** Currently supported commands

| ~eval~      |Evaluates an expression and prints out computed result. issue: record types are printed as tuples                                                                                                                                                                       |~:eval 2 + 2~                      |

*** Command shortcuts

It is not required to type whole command in every case – a prefix is just enough if it is not ambiguous.
For example, at the moment of writing ~:t 3~ is equivalent to ~:type 3~ , while ~:un~ will return an
error, because it could mean both ~:unlet~ and ~undeploy~. If a valid command is a proper prefix of another
one, it will take the prtiority.

*** let-definitions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: letdefs
:END:

~let-definitions~ are all values assigned using ~:let~ command. They are statically bound, meaning that
the following behavior is expected:
#+BEGIN_SRC
AESO> :let x = 1
AESO> :let y = x
AESO> :let x = 0
AESO> x
0
AESO> y
1
#+END_SRC
Here, we do not redefine existing ~x~, but we just /shadow/ it. The ~y~ still sees the previous definition.
This applies to functions as well. If a value depends on in-REPL state, its value *won't* change if the state
is altered.

Functions defined as ~:let~ are not stateful, nor payable. They cannot interact with [def-definitions].

Use of ~:let~ definitions may increase (but not decrease) displayed gas usage, so they shouldn't be used while
testing this property.

*** def-definitions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: defdefs
:END:

~def-definitions~ are functions defined by ~:def~ command. They cannot be redefined or shadowed, but are allowed to
be both ~stateful~ and ~payable~. They are vanished when user changes in-REPL state by using ~:set state~ command or
when they do it explicitly by calling ~:undef~. While they cannot interact with ~:let~  functions, they can use ~:let~ values.

They do not introduce any artificial gas overhead as long as there are no ~:let~ values in the environment.


*** list command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: list-command
:END:

~:list~ supports following arguments:

| ~contracts~       | Displays tracked contracts' names                                                                                                |
| ~let~             | Displays all ~:let~ definitions                                                                                                  |
| ~def~             | Displays all ~:def~ definitions                                                                                                  |
| ~letval~          | Displays all non-functional ~:let~ values                                                                                        |
| ~letfun~          | Displays all functional ~:let~ values                                                                                            |
| ~names~           | Displays all names that belong to current env                                                                                    |

*** REPL values

These can be adjusted using ~:set~ commands. Currently supported options are:

| Value                        | Type of next arg                                           | Description                                                                    |
| ~call_gas~                   | ~true~ or ~false~                                          | Toggles display of used gas during evaluations                                 |
| ~gas~                        | Positive integer                                           | Sets amount of has to provide to every evaluation                              |
| ~aevm~                       | No args                                                    | Switches to aevm. Not maintained at all.                                       |
| ~fate~                       | No args                                                    | Switches to fate. Default.                                                     |
| ~state~                      | Sophia expresion                                           | See [in-REPL state]                                                            |

*** in-REPL state

The REPL tracks its own internal state that works similarly to the contracts' states. By default its state is set to ~() : unit~, but it can be changed at any time via ~:set~ command:
#+BEGIN_SRC
AESO> state
()
AESO> :set state 1
AESO> put(state + 1)
()
AESO> state
1
#+END_SRC

State altering routines can be defined through ~:def~ definitions. Note that if you change the state via ~:set~ command all ~:def~ functions will be erased (since the type of the state may change). ~:let~ definitions may read the state, but they cannot change it. They will always use the state from the moment they were created, see the following snippet:
#+BEGIN_SRC
AESO> :set state 1
AESO> :let f() = state
AESO> f()
1
AESO> put(2)
AESO> f()
1
AESO> :set state true
AESO> f()
1
#+END_SRC

*** Misc.

Newline symbol can be replaced by colon. This is very straightforward and it is a temporary "feature" that will be removed. It just allows to write quick oneliners like ~let x = 2;put(x)~.

If you want to insert more complex multiline you can do it in GHCi's style using ~:{~ to open and ~:}~ to close your expression
#+BEGIN_SRC
AESO> :{
| let id(x) = x
| id(2138)
:}
2138
#+END_SRC
